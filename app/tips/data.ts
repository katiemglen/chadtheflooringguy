Just think, Niagara Falls erodes 1 foot per year with constant water flow. 🚿 Your floors will erode or degrade at a much slower rate than this World Wonder, but they do erode from dirt and sand constantly being ground into high traffic areas like entryways, kitchens, mudrooms and hallways. Who knew that Swiffer or broom would be the bees knees when it comes to the longevity of your floors? 😜`,

    content: `FALSE! Stop that. No. Put it down. Never again. Why? Steam cleaning may feel like a great way to clean the floor, yet you are putting moisture into the CREASES of the flooring and moisture is getting into your subfloor as well as creating a place for mold to grow. Chad's biggest concern is that the extra moisture and heat could actually bow the flooring, meaning the floor would start lifting up and bending like an arch. If you like clean floors, consider using a microfiber cloth on a Swiffer mop, trying a unique mop/sponge that has good grippy on it to really absorb the dirt, or checking out Reddit or Amazon Reviews for what other people are using. (When I say "mop", I mean the Swiffer mop thing with the wiping pads. We don't ever advise using a real mop with splashing water to clean your floors. Only use just enough moisture to get the dirt off the floor and you are happy!)`,

Any moisture means floor damage, mold potential if the wetness gets stuck under the floor, an arching or bowing floor, and sad homeowners. Instead, use gentle cleaning solutions like vacuuming the floor or sweeping. Then, wipe down the floor with a cleaning utensil like a Swiffer or floor mop. 🧹`,

    content: `Use the "suck" feature on your vacuum cleaner to gently clean LVP and hardwood floors. NO MOVING BRISTLES (please!) Yes, you can totally vacuum your floor to get all the coffee beans, bell pepper seeds, and rice spilled off the floor. For sure! (No, pick them up one speck at a time! JK 😘🤪) Use the suction only feature, turn off the bristles, and go over the floor. The bristles usually spit the things on the floor into hyperspace at a fast trajectory all over (very lame for cleaning) and the bristles can potentially scratch your floor. We like to vacuum the LVP floor with our Dyson house vacuum (or if you're cool, you have a backpack vacuum or Shark 😎) with the bristles turned off. Then, we "mop" the floor, which is just wiping the floor with a microfiber cloth on the end of a Swiffer mop, and spraying our cleaner on the floor as we go.\n\n👍 Vacuuming approved\n👎 Bristles not approved`,

Because it won't be ME that scratches the floor, it usually is someone else who moves something and pushes it, not knowing that there might be some little speck of dirt or sand under there, which has now been pushed across the floor, leaving a HUGE scratch.

(I'm guilty of having to break that habit from childhood!) Oh, you have a water-proof floor? Nah, we'd like to say from our experience that those marketing terms basically mean "water resistant" and you have a certain amount of time before it seeps into the cracks or floor joints before it gets to your subfloor. Changing or adding in happy habits can be easy with little positive reinforcements. Next time you spill, try out a new way of thinking, like saying out loud, "oops, got it!" with a smile 😄 And clean it up quickly and easily. 🤩`,

Try and soak up as much as you can, change out rags if needed. You might have gotten it all or you may need to use a floor cleaner to get the rest out. I've personally been down this rabbit hole on Reddit and found a great carpet spray cleaner that I've had amazing success with. (Not promoting or being paid to say this!) 😀 Product: Awesome Carpet Spot and Stain Remover. Yes, that's the legit name. I've had awesome success and enjoy it! I think you can even get it locally super cheap, too, not just from Amazon. Hope this helps with being prepared for stain removal! What are you all using to remove stains? Any fun new products that I should try? 🧐`,

There is a whole world out there of unexplored cleaning solutions and there is no way that I would ever be able to try them all! We like to use natural cleaning solutions (and I use Pine-Sol sometimes, because that's the power 💪!) LOL marketing is so helpful. ✨️ Test out your products on your floor to see if anything happens to the finish and color, as well as to see if you like the smell of the cleaner! When we go to try new things that we know will be impactful for a lot of things over time, we like to research and see what reviews are for products and tools. Sometimes, it saves us a lot of time and money just taking a moment to read about what other people are using and how it's helped or not helped them. I'm all for impulse purchases, but when it comes to cleaning, I figure I will most likely use a brand for a while before switching (if I switch at all!).`,

Using a furniture slider is SO much easier to move your couches, buffets, dressers, etc. One person can move a really heavy piece! Using a slider won't tug at the carpet when you push the furniture. Tugging at the carpet can pull the carpet off the tack strips, if it wasn't installed tightly, and you now have carpet wrinkles! Prevent your floor from premature wrinkles by using carpet sliders OR manually lift up and move what you desire without pushing the furniture across the floor.`,

From our experience, we like to use natural cleaners for our own LVP flooring in our living spaces. (Following story is not paid advertising, we just like research and trying new things!) During COVID, Chad went to town researching different prebiotic cleaners; using his knowledge from a previous occupation in MMA and strike coaching, the gym mats would always be disinfected constantly to prevent staph infections and keep the place clean. Well, we found a probiotic cleaner that we mix up when we need it, spray our counters and wipe up. We tried it on our floor and LOVE the results. We take a microfiber cloth, put it on the Swiffer mop, spray the floor with a new batch of cleaner, and mop like normal on our LVP. There are a lot of great options out there for products and just happen to have found this one. What are you guys using and why do you like it? (I'm actually curious and really want to know!)`,
